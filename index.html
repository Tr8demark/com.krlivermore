        <p>
            This site is place for me to test some codes that I may be wanting to implement on
            other projects. As you can see this site is fairly barren save for the headers and
            this paragraph, but I will be adding features little by little. My plans for this
            site are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add resume</li>
            <li><del>Add multiple pages</del></li>
            <li><del>Display buttons along top of webpage that will lead to various pages.</del>
                <li>Stylize buttons</li>
                <li>Have spacing for buttons (possible iFrame fix)</li></li>
            <li>Implement a background that can be utilized on all pages and that won't clash with
                stylized text colors.</li>
            <li>Add back button for Resume page that's outside of the text container.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            I also have projects that I would like to complete and post here in a portfolio fashion:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Amazon price scraper that texts/emails about specific items and their respective prices.
                <li>Possibly graph them over time.</li></li>
            <li>A webpage that will search multiple used book websites (Books-a-million, Amazon, ThriftBooks, B&N, etc) and find the best price of a book based off of its ISBN.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
